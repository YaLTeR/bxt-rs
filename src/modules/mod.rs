//! Modules providing the actual functionality.
//!
//! The idea is that each module has more or less self-contained functionality and function pointer
//! requirements. This way if some function pointer isn't found, it disables only those modules
//! which require it for functioning, while everything else stays working.
//!
//! Every module is represented by a unit struct implementing the [`Module`] trait. All modules live
//! in the global [`MODULES`] array where they all can be operated on at once as trait objects.

// Modules have a lot of unsafe functions that are only intended to be called in one particular spot
// of the game code, and nowhere else. They are frequently called accordingly, too, e.g.
// `on_pm_move_start()`. Documenting this for every such function doesn't seem to add any meaningful
// clarity while being tedious. Therefore, allow missing safety doc for modules.
